// map rows into array of blueprint objects
// need to do some maths to work out the ratio of ore to clay robots needed. not sure how that'll work
// loop through each blueprint for 24 minutes, keeping track of inventories
// // this needs to be smart, somehow, not random. hopefully the maths from above will help
// calculate quality level
