// Trial and error algo
// Loop over all blueprints
//     Add a console log every time a new blueprint starts
// Backtracking/recursion
//     Given we’re running for just 20-odd minutes, we shouldn’t run into problems re: reaching the stack limit
//     However, it might take a while to run, since it’s essentially a brute-force method that has to evaluate every single possibility
//         Is there a way to filter out ones that are unlikely to yield anything good?
// Evaluate every single combination by doing the following every time:
//     Build every type of robot you can
//     Build nothing
// When we reach the maximum amount of minutes, update the maximum number of geodes, then return
//     Possibly add a log every time we reach this point, just so we know how fast/slow the script is running
//     If it’s cluttered, then perhaps every time the max number is updated
// Do the addition etc.
