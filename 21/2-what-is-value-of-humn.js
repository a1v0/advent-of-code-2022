// turn input into object, as in Task 1
// store both four-letter groups marked in root
// evaluate everything you can without knowing value of humn
// this should yield two expressions, each containing humn as an unknown value
// let humn = 0 (assuming that values will only ever be positive)
// while loop to run until both expressions are equal
// return value of humn
