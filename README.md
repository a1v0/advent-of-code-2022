# advent-of-code-2022

My code for calculating the answers for Advent of Code 2022, entirely in JavaScript.

The tasks can be found **[here](https://adventofcode.com/2022)**, and each day's inputs are stored within that day's directory.

|16|Task 1:&nbsp;❌&mdash;trying to implement a Dijkstra solution but it's a huge mess. To be revisited.|
|17|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;❌&mdash;very close to the right answer. I believe I have identified the flaw in my code but am unsure how to repair it. To be revisited.|
|18|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;❌&mdash;works with test data but not with real data. Debugging has so far yielded nothing.|
