# advent-of-code-2022

My code for calculating the answers for Advent of Code 2022, entirely in JavaScript.

The tasks can be found **[here](https://adventofcode.com/2022)**, and each day's inputs are stored within that day's directory. Towards the latter half of the month, I began to add (primarily primitive) unit tests, using Jest.

| Day | Status |

|01|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|02|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|

|07|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|08|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|09|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|10|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|11|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐&mdash;admittedly solved by taking a peek at the AoC subreddit.|
|12|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|13|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|14|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|15|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|16|Task 1:&nbsp;❌&mdash;trying to implement a Dijkstra solution but it's a huge mess. To be revisited.|
|17|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;❌&mdash;very close to the right answer. I believe I have identified the flaw in my code but am unsure how to repair it. To be revisited.|
|18|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|19|Task 1:&nbsp;❌&mdash;completely stuck on this one, alas.|
|20|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|21|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;⭐|
|22|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;❌&mdash;unsure how to approach this.|
|23|Task 1:&nbsp;❌&mdash;works with test data but not with real data. Cannot identify source of bug.|
|24|Task 1:&nbsp;❌&mdash;grappling with RangeError. To be revisited.|
|25|Task 1:&nbsp;⭐<br>Task 2:&nbsp;The last challenge is inaccessible until I've completed everything else.|
