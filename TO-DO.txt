To-do list:

- format with Prettier
- 04.1: create separate callback function to map strings directly into full range, skipping the hyphenation mapping stage
- 05.2: refactor based on 05.1
- 06.1: continue to improve if statements, perhaps using better variable naming
- 06.2: refactor based on 06.1
- 07.1: look at `commands.shift(); // removes [""] that was left when we created commandsStrings` and assess whether it can be moved elsewhere or handled differently
- 07.2: refactor based on 07.1
- 09.1: rename coordinates to something more descriptive so that explanatory comment can be removed
