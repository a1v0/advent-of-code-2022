To-do list:

- 09.1: rename "coordinates" to something more descriptive so that explanatory comment can be removed
- 12.1: rename variables to be a bit more descriptive
- 12.1: see if you can reduce repetition below multi-line comment
- 12.1: xFromEnd * xFromEnd + (yFromEnd + yFromEnd): shouldn't that be  xFromEnd * xFromEnd + yFromEnd * yFromEnd?
- 15.1: see if you can combine last forEach into the preceding one
- 20.2: check re: test (see first comment), then refactor as normal
- 21.1: "let monkeyCry": can't this be const?
- 22.1: move move() outside of main method, and return the updated value of "direction"
- AFTER ALL: format with Prettier
