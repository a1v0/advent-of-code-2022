To-do list:

- format with Prettier
- 04.1: create separate callback function to map strings directly into full range, skipping the hyphenation mapping stage
- 05.2: refactor based on 05.1
- 06.1: continue to improve if statements, perhaps using better variable naming
- 06.2: refactor based on 06.1
