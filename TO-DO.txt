To-do list:

- format with Prettier
- 04.1: create separate callback function to map strings directly into full range, skipping the hyphenation mapping stage
- 05.2: refactor based on 05.1
- 06.1: continue to improve if statements, perhaps using better variable naming
- 06.2: refactor based on 06.1
- 07.1: look at `commands.shift(); // removes [""] that was left when we created commandsStrings` and assess whether it can be moved elsewhere or handled differently
- 07.2: refactor based on 07.1
- 09.1: rename "coordinates" to something more descriptive so that explanatory comment can be removed
- 12.1: rename variables to be a bit more descriptive
- 12.1: see if you can reduce repetition below multi-line comment
- 12.1: xFromEnd * xFromEnd + (yFromEnd + yFromEnd): shouldn't that be  xFromEnd * xFromEnd + yFromEnd * yFromEnd?
- 15.1: see if you can combine last forEach into the preceding one
- 20.2: check re: test (see first comment), then refactor as normal
- 21.1: "let monkeyCry": can't this be const?
- 22.1: move move() outside of main method, and return the updated value of "direction"
